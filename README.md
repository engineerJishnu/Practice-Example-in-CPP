Hello! This is Jishnu Chakrabarti. I am Printing Engineer by profession  & is passionate about Robotics and AI. 

In my free time especially after office hours, I am writing codes - GPIO programming for Raspberry Pi using C++. 

Programming languages are tools. Like most tools, which tool to use depends on what you want to build. C++ is used for applications where performance and proper resource utilization are of high priorities. So, its used to develop firmware for embedded systems such as microntrollers and embedded processors for controlling home appliances, motors, robots and so on. The microntrollers and embedded processors have memory constraints and many of them doesn't even have operating system.

I felt that by learning  C++ will help me to understand the basic concepts such as: Memory Management, Pointers, object oriented programming etc. Since, I have serious intention of becoming a high quality software engineer, rather than just being a hobbyist, web or junior developer, hence I decided to learn C++.

An analogy: if you build a house without good, strong foundations, it may stand for a year, or two years, but at some point it will fall over. If, however, you build a house with decent foundations, even though you may never look at those foundations again in your lifetime, you can guarantee your house is structurally sound and will sustain without worrying about it falling down around you.

C++  is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

 My  purpose of writing C++ programming examples is mainly to get acquainted with basic syntax of  C++ inorder to get started and then slowly take a deep dive into creating the complex programs.

For this, I am looking for a platform on an Industrial IOT firm where C++ is also used apart from other web building frameworks. 

This exampe is done on windows 10 platform using Microsoft Visual Studio - Community Edition.

(Remote jobs are only for self-starters and self-managers. It requires discipline, focus, ability, and of course, a task that can be done remotely. That said, I never work in my pajamas.)
