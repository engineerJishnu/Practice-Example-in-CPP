Hello! This is Jishnu Chakrabarti. I am Printing Engineer profession by day & is passionate in Robotics and AI. In my free time, I write codes - GPIO programming on Open Source Hardware using C++.

C++ programming example by self learning mainly to get acquainted with basic syntax of C++ inorder to get started and then slowly take a deep dive into creating the complex programs.

For this, I am looking for a platform either in gaming industry or an Industrial IOT firm where C++ is also used apart from other web building frameworks.

This is done on windows 10 platform using Microsoft Visual Studio - Community Edition.
