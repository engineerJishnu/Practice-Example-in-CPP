Hello! This is Jishnu Chakrabarti. I am Printing Engineer by profession  & is passionate about Robotics and AI. 

In my free time, I am writing codes - GPIO programming for Raspberry Pi using C++. 

C++  is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

By learning  C++ you will learn basic concepts such as: Memory Management, Pointers, object oriented programming etc. If you have a serious intention of becoming a high quality professional developer, rather than just being a hobbyist, web or junior developer, then I would suggest learning C++.

C++ is used for applications where performance proper resource utilization are of high priorities. Develop firmware for embedded systems such as microntrollers and embedded processors for controlling home appliances, car's fuel injection, motors, robots and so on. Those systems have memory constraints and many of them doesn't even have operating system.



An analogy: if you build a house without good, strong foundations, it may stand for a year, or two years, but at some point it will fall over. If, however, you build a house with decent foundations, even though you may never look at those foundations again in your lifetime, you can guarantee your house is structurally sound and can go about your business without worrying about it falling down around you. Developers who start out with a high level language like C# or Java are building their house without foundations. C++ also has the advantage that it is an open ISO standard not owned or controlled by any one corporation in the way that e.g. Java, Swift, C# are. This might matter less to you than it does to me.

WHY should I (or anyone) pick up C++ in 2018?
High Performance Computing - C++ is one of the few high level languages with high performance and and direct access to the operating system system calls that are exposed in C. 

When performance is absolutely critical because you're making real time systems, large scale AI, or scale is so huge that perf matters (Big 4 & co.) C++ is the clear winner. My skill set is heavily c++ skewed and I have seen no shortage of high paying jobs.
C++ is also a great language for building a lower level understanding of computers since it operates very close to the metal and concepts like cache locality start to become more relevant. Knowing how a system works under the hood will probably help you write better code in other languages too.






Programming languages are tools. Like most tools, which tool to use depends on what you want to build. The purpose of writing C++ programming examples by self learning mainly to get acquainted with basic syntax of  C++ inorder to get started and then slowly take a deep dive into creating the complex programs.

For this, I am looking for a platform either in gaming industry or an Industrial IOT firm where C++ is also used apart from other web building frameworks. Remote jobs are only for self-starters and self-managers. It requires discipline, focus, ability, and of course, a task that can be done remotely. That said, I never work in my pajamas.

This is done on windows 10 platform using Microsoft Visual Studio - Community Edition.
